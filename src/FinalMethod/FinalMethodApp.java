package FinalMethod;

// # Final Method
//   - The 'final' keyword can also be used in Method.
//   - If we add the final keyword to a method,
//     this means that the method cannot be overridden anymore in its child class.
//   - This is very suitable if we want to lock
//     the implementation of a method so that it cannot be changed again by the child class.
