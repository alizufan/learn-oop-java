package ObjectClass;

// # What is Object Class ?
//   - In Java, every class we create is automatically an instance of the Object class.
//   - Even though we don't directly explicitly mention extends Object,
//     Java will automatically make our class extends Object.
//   - You could say the Object class is a superclass for all classes in Java.
